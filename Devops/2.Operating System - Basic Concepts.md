### **Extra Concepts to Add**

* **Kernel vs OS**

  * Kernel = core of OS
  * OS = kernel + utilities

* **Types of OS**

  * Single-user, Multi-user
  * Batch, Time-sharing
  * Real-time

* **Thread vs Process**

  * Thread = lightweight process
  * Shares memory with process

* **Context Switching**

  * CPU switching between processes.

* **User Mode vs Kernel Mode**

  * User: limited access
  * Kernel: full hardware access

* **System Calls**

  * Interface between app and OS.

---

### **Extra Interview Questions**

* **Process vs Thread?**
  Process is heavyweight, thread is lightweight.

* **What is context switching?**
  CPU switching execution.

* **User mode vs kernel mode?**
  Safety and control separation.

* **Why Linux preferred in servers?**
  Stable, secure, customizable.
